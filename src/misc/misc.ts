Some helpful tips:
- You need to be an administrator to create new projects
- Only the assigned staff member and the project owner can mark tasks complete
- Additional staff can be added to individual episodes for one-off tasks
- If odd episode numbers are needed (episode 0, episode 7.5, etc) use \`/addepisode\`
- If you need additional assistance, contact 9volt.
